Technologies Used
-AWS Lambda
-API Gateway
-Python
-Git & GitHub
-PowerShell (for local testing)

This Lambda project uses CI/CD because:

-Changes are automatically tested and deployed when pushed to the GitHub repository after being tested locally in Powershell & VScode.

-No manual deployment is required, GitHub Actions handles the full automation.

-The function is always up-to-date in AWS with the latest code from the main or master branch.

-Version-controlled infrastructure ensures consistent and reliable deployments.

-By automating the workflow using GitHub Actions and deploying straight to AWS Lambda, this project follows core DevOps practices for CI/CD.
